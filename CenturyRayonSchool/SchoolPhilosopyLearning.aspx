                        According to Dr. Sarala Birla, “Education is a meaningless ritual unless it moulds the character of students and imparts in them strong sense of values”. The School strongly believes in her philosophy that the students have to be developed in all aspects to build a unique nation. Students should grow into responsible and confident global citizens, who know to learn, unlearn and relearn.

                        All our learning activities center around students. We ensure that students are active participants in the learning process and eventually & mould them to take ownership of the learning. We attempt to attain this by providing a wide range of interconnected learning opportunities that help children discover and develop their strengths.
