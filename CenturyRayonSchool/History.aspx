                        In the year 1952,Late Shri Basant Kumar Birla, the 31 year old younger
son of Shri Ghanshyam Das Birla,
laid the foundation for his first independent venture, Century Rayon
at Shahad, along Murbad Road on the bank of Ulhas River.
The Birla family has always operated beyond business through numerous
community initiatives in education, health, philanthropy
and humanitarianism. To steer these activities around Century Rayon, the Kalyan Charitable Trust (KCT) was formed in 1956, under the stewardship of Late Dr Sarala Birla.

                        One of the first endeavors of KCT was to expand the national chain of Birla Temples, by constructing the grandiose Vithoba Mandir at the picturesque hill top of Shahad. The magnificent structure is built of sandstone in the Nagar style of architecture with intricate carvings on pillars and walls. The regal temple complex augmented by the beautiful Shivaji Udyan offer the local community a serene gateway.

                        One of the major social out reach programs undertaken by Century Rayon way back in 1958 was
the creation of Century Rayon High School with the noble objective to actively contribute to the
development of local community. It started with a modest strength of 50 students, the School today has on its roll 4500 students. The School is affiliated to The Maharashtra State Education Board.
